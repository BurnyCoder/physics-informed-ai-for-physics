# Physics-Based AI for Physics

This project implements deep learning models specifically designed for physics problems. The repository contains tools for:

- Loading and preprocessing physics datasets
- Building physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
- Training models with physical constraints
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing results

## Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains dataset handling code and example datasets
- `models/`: Neural network architectures for physics problems
- `training/`: Training utilities, loss functions, and physics constraints
- `utils/`: Helper functions for visualization and evaluation
- `examples/`: Example scripts for training and inference

## Usage

See the examples directory for detailed usage examples:

```bash
# Run an example training script
python examples/train_pendulum.py
```

## Supported Physics Problems

- Pendulum motion dynamics
- Wave propagation
- Fluid dynamics (basic)
